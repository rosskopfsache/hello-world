# hello-world
Getting started with GitHub

I'm about to do my first project in GitHub and called it **Hello-World**
My Goals are:
1. Getting that GitHub Project running
2. Learning how to document my changes with Markdown-Language
3. Installing and using Ansible
4. Becoming a great ` echo developer ;-) ` 

That's pretty much it for the first step
